### Scaning Products to help stores

As we're launching our new computer store, we would like to have a few opening day specials.

-We're going to have a 3 for 2 deal on Apple TVs. For example, if you buy 3 Apple TVs, you will pay the price of 2 only
-The brand new Super iPad will have a bulk discounted applied, where the price will drop to $499.99 each, if someone buys more than 4

As our Sales manager is quite indecisive, we want the pricing rules to be as flexible as possible as they can change in the future with little notice.

Our checkout system can scan items in any order.
